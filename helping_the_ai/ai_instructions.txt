Project Instructions
This is meant to be a static site to replace my Ghost blog. The idea is to use Gatsby to serve up content written in .md files, so adding a new blog entry is as easy as writing a new .md file.
I intend to keep my images small and therefore do not need anything more complicated than a folder in the project from which they can be referenced in the markdown files.
Keep to the same general theme and look of the current site while making useful enhancements.  

General Instructions: 
1. At the end of every action sequence, write a log entry with the current time and date to a file in helping_the_ai\ai-logs. There should be one file per day. If the file does not exist for today, create it, and start with a summary of the previous several files as needed. The log entries should briefly but completely summarize the work that was done and the functionality that was accomplished. 
2. At the start of every action sequence, read the ai_log file for this day to understand what is going on and what was done so far.
3. In the root of the project there is folder called helping_the_ai. This contains useful context aids. In no case should the contents of that folder be modified. 

Cline Custom Instructions
Always look to see if there is an helping_the_ai\ai_instructions.txt file in the project and pay attention to it's contents.
