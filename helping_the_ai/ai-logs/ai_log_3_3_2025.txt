Updated blog posts with tags to enhance the tag heatmap functionality:

1. Tag Implementation:
   - Added appropriate tags to 7 blog posts that were previously missing tags:
     - dynamic-dns-with-azure-automation.md: Added tags ["Azure", "DNS", "Automation", "PowerShell", "Hybrid Worker"]
     - dynamic-dns-in-azure-v2.md: Added tags ["Azure", "DNS", "Logic Apps", "KQL", "Log Analytics", "Azure Arc"]
     - backup-vault-deletion.md: Added tags ["Azure", "Backup", "PowerShell", "Troubleshooting"]
     - where-is-invocationid.md: Added tags ["Azure", "Azure Functions", "PowerShell", "Troubleshooting", "Logging"]
     - schedule-disabling-azure-ad-user.md: Added tags ["Azure", "Azure AD", "Logic Apps", "Identity Management", "Automation"]
     - monitoring-office-365-audit-log.md: Added tags ["Office 365", "Azure", "Automation", "PowerShell", "MSP", "Security"]
     - add-storagetablerow-error.md: Added tags ["Azure", "PowerShell", "Storage Tables", "Error Handling", "Troubleshooting"]
   - Ensured tags were relevant to the content of each blog post
   - Maintained consistent tag naming conventions across all posts

2. Tag Heatmap Enhancement:
   - The existing tag-heatmap component now displays a more comprehensive set of tags
   - Tags are displayed with varying font sizes based on their frequency across blog posts
   - The heatmap provides better navigation by linking tags to filtered blog post lists

This update enhances the site's navigation and content organization by implementing a comprehensive tagging system. The tag heatmap now provides users with a visual representation of the blog's content categories, making it easier to find related posts and explore topics of interest.

Implemented tag filtering functionality for blog posts:

1. Tag Filtering Implementation:
   - Updated the blogs.js page to filter posts based on the selected tag from the URL query parameter
   - Modified the page title to show which tag is currently being filtered
   - Added a "Clear filter" link to allow users to return to viewing all posts
   - Ensured the tag heatmap continues to show all available tags even when filtering is active

2. UI Enhancements:
   - Added CSS styles for the "Clear filter" link to maintain consistent design
   - Improved the page title layout to accommodate the filter information
   - Ensured the tag heatmap component uses the complete list of posts for tag calculation

3. Blog Post Template Improvements:
   - Enhanced the blog-post.js template to display featured images
   - Ensured tag links in individual blog posts correctly link to filtered blog lists

This implementation creates a seamless tag-based navigation experience. Users can now click on any tag (either from the tag heatmap or from individual blog posts) to see a filtered list of posts with that specific tag. This makes content discovery more intuitive and helps users find related content more easily.

Enhanced link visibility in the blog:

1. Link Styling Improvement:
   - Updated the global CSS to make links more visually distinct from regular text
   - Changed link color from white (#ffffff) to bright blue (#0099ff) to stand out against the black background
   - Added a hover state that changes links to a different shade of blue (#4a69bd)
   - Maintained text decoration behavior (no underline by default, underline on hover)

This update improves the user experience by making hyperlinks immediately recognizable within the content. Links now stand out visually from the surrounding text, making navigation more intuitive while maintaining the site's overall aesthetic.
