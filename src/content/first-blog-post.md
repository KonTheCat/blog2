# Getting Started with Azure Functions

Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that enables you to run code on-demand without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure. Use Azure Functions to run a script or piece of code in response to a variety of events.

## What are Azure Functions?

Azure Functions is a solution for easily running small pieces of code, or "functions," in the cloud. You can write just the code you need for the problem at hand, without worrying about a whole application or the infrastructure to run it.

Functions can make development even more productive, and you can use your development language of choice, such as C#, F#, Node.js, Python, or PHP.

## Key Benefits

- **Serverless Applications**: Focus on your code, not the infrastructure
- **Pay-per-use Pricing**: Pay only for the time your code runs
- **Scalability**: Azure Functions scales automatically based on demand
- **Event-driven**: Functions are triggered by events in Azure services or third-party services
- **Flexibility**: Choose your language, run on Windows or Linux, and integrate with various services

## Getting Started

To get started with Azure Functions, you'll need:

1. An Azure account
2. Visual Studio, VS Code, or the Azure Functions Core Tools
3. The Azure Functions extension for your IDE

Here's a simple example of an HTTP-triggered function in PowerShell:

```powershell
param($Request, $TriggerMetadata)

$name = $Request.Query.Name
if (-not $name) {
    $name = $Request.Body.Name
}

$body = "Hello, $name!"

Push-OutputBinding -Name Response -Value ([HttpResponseContext]@{
    StatusCode = [HttpStatusCode]::OK
    Body = $body
})
```

This function responds to HTTP requests with a personalized greeting.

## Next Steps

In future posts, we'll explore more advanced Azure Functions scenarios, including:

- Working with different triggers and bindings
- Integrating with other Azure services
- Implementing durable functions for stateful workflows
- Deploying and monitoring your functions
