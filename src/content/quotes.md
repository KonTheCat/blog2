This page contains a collection of my favorite quotes related to existing in the modern world as a human being, technologist, and professional (and just funny meme stuff).

### A King may move a man

> "A King may move a man, a father may claim a son, but remember that even when those who move you be Kings, or men of power, your soul is in your keeping alone. When you stand before God, you cannot say, "But I was told by others to do thus." Or that, "Virtue was not convenient at the time." This will not suffice. Remember that."
> ― King Baldwin IV in Kingdom of Heaven

I substitute my own conscience for God, but you do as you will with this one.

### The Sayings of the Shellfather/Snoverisms:

> "PowerShell: Like programming with hand grenades."  
> "When in trouble, fear, or doubt, run in circles, scream and shout."  
> "Microsoft is incapable of sustained error."  
> "So in the IT profession, we learn new things. If you didn’t want to learn new things, you should get into lumber. There has not been a new tree in quite a long time."  
> "Not upgrading from [an old version of Windows] is like the guy who jumps off a building and, on the way down, says, “so far, so good.”"  
> "Running a GUI on a server is like heroin. At first click, it’s great, but before you know it you’re full of viruses and dying in an alley."  
> "Can PowerShell Remoting v2 and v3 talk to each other? Yes. There’s this process where they talk to each other, like two dogs singing each other’s butts, and figure out each other’s capabilities."  
> "Being agile is great. But be careful with hacking code. It’s a lot like peeing your pants: at first, it’s nice. Warm, and moist. But then you have to live with the consequences."
